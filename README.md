## The Problems We Solve in Morocco

1. **People die waiting for care**  
   In the High Atlas, Rif mountains, or southern oases, a sudden asthma attack, severe hypertension, or diabetic crisis can turn deadly before anyone reaches a clinic—hours of travel, no money for a taxi, no road at all.

2. **Long waits and wasted time**  
   Even for routine care, people lose hours—or days—traveling from remote villages to clinics.

3. **Missed or delayed diagnoses**  
   Doctors often work with incomplete information. Patients forget details, symptoms are hard to describe, and early signs in scans can be overlooked.

4. **Health research lacks local insight**  
   Public health teams and associations struggle to get reliable, real-time data on what’s happening in Moroccan communities.

5. **Patients don’t understand their conditions**  
   Most leave the doctor’s office confused, following advice without knowing *why* it matters or how to protect themselves.

6. **Access to licensed care is limited**  
   Finding a qualified doctor quickly is nearly impossible outside major cities—and telemedicine often ignores local licensing rules.

## How We Fix It

- **HealthTrack** – Snap a photo of your meal with any phone, get instant nutrition facts. Log symptoms daily so your doctor sees the full picture—even from a mountain village.
- **MediConnect** – Book a licensed Moroccan doctor for a 15–30 minute video call. Works on 3G. No travel down winding roads.
- **HealthInsight** – Local health organizations get anonymous trends (e.g., rising hypertension in High Atlas communities) to send help where it’s needed most.
- **HealthFlow** – Community clinics, schools, and mobile health units run group wellness sessions online.

**AI that helps, not replaces:**  
- Scans X-rays and MRIs to flag possible tumors (brain, blood cancers).  
- Reads facial expressions during calls to support mental health checks.  
- All results go to the doctor—final decision always human.

**Clear, practical education for every patient**  
We explain every condition in simple terms—why it happens, what to do, how to stay safe. No jargon. Available in Arabic, French, and Tamazight. Patients leave informed, not confused.

**Special Support for People in Need – Especially in Remote Areas**  
We reach families in far-off places: the High Atlas, Rif mountains, desert villages.  
A private need assessment identifies financial hardship.  
Doctors confirm eligibility in seconds.  
HealthCore covers **up to 70 % of the consultation fee**, funded by platform revenue and impact capital.  
No one in a remote douar should skip care because of distance or cost.
